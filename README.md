# BAINSA-Knowledge-Graph
This repository contains the work of a Bocconi AI and Neuroscience Association team tasked with building a knowledge graph of the English Wikipedia.

<h3> Introduction </h3>

A ’knowledge graph’ is a network of entities that captures information on the
relationships between different topics. In the case of Wikipedia, the vast body
of articles spanning countless different domains makes it suitable for a good
representation of human knowledge that can yield interesting results. Our
project attempts to construct the structure of the graph and use it to build and
train machine learning models that leverage both natural language processing
and the topology of the graph.

<h3> Contents </h3>

The notebooks and scripts containted in this repo deal with processing and cleaning data from the Wiki dumps. Our implementation of the general graph class and Dijsktra's algorithm are also included. Updates on our current work are coming soon!
